<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My overarching research vision is to develop novel approaches for optimization in operations research-esque environments. To this end, I take a two-pronged approach in research: algorithmic development and algorithmic analysis/testing. Combined, I hope to build a more nuanced comprehension of the field and have a wider reach with my work. </p>

<h2>Space Systems Design Studio</h2>
<h5>Cislunar Explorers</h5>
<p></p>
<p>My work at Space Systems Design Studio (SSDS) involved working with Cislunar Explorer's satellite and ground station to make sure that the two were correctly performing their tasks. My efforts were initially devoted towards hardware, and thus I focused heavily on making sure our individual ground station components were working and testing the uplinking and downlinking processes between our model satellite (flatsat) and our ground station. Over time, I began moving more into software, initially working with registration key manipulation to fix our encryption scheme for downlinking and eventually moving onto the optical navigation subteam, where I worked on dynamic position estimation and testing for our satellite using <b>unscented Kalman filters</b>. </p>

<h2>McMahon Lab</h2>
<p></p>
<p> Due to the computational difficulty with computing minimums for certain problems like vehicle routing problems with time windows (VRPTWs), it can be viable to approach these problems using non-traditional means such at the <b>coherent Ising machine</b> (CIM), a physical solver. Our goal is to benchmark the CIM and compare it to traditional solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, especially for large instances. </p>
