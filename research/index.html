<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My overarching research vision is to better understand <b>embodied intelligence</b> by creating new physical forms and analyzing how current digital forms are created. I pursue this vision through two branches: robot design and networked cultures. These two approaches combine to form a unified approach for more ethical embodiment both on and off-screen. </p>

<h2>Robotics</h2>
<h5>Digital Intelligence, Physical Embodiment</h5>
<p></p>
<p>In robotics, my focus is on <b>computational material robots</b> -- robots with advanced functionality through the algorithmic design of their material properties. Robotics is traditionally the combination of three fields: mechanical engineering, computer science and electrical engineering. Recently, there has been more of a push to add a fourth field to the mix, material science, creating new <a href="http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/robotics/2/12/eaar4527.full.pdf">material robots</a> that use the embedded intelligence within their material properties to create new techniques. My goal is to create customizable computational material robotics so that given a task, robots can be autonomously designed, optimized and fabricated for any application. This has led me to create novel <b>soft robotic manipulators</b> and <b>modular volumetric actuators</b>, as well as explored the needed sensors and computation to allow for these robots to interact with their environment and be produced efficiently.</p>

<h2>Internet Studies</h2>
<h5>Physical Intelligence, Digital Embodiment</h5>
<p></p>

<p>In media studies, my focus is on better understanding <b>how one's digital identity is formed</b>, especially when it's created by someone else. I draw from infrastructure studies, feminist studies and ethnographic methods to do this analysis, in the hopes of avoiding the current conflicts in identity creation from repeating in robotic design.</p>
