	<p>Hello there! My name is <b>Tyler King</b> and I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am currently associated with <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">McMahon's Lab</a>, where I work on simulating dynamics of the coherent Ising machine for vehicle routing problems in collaboration with ExxonMobil. Last summer I was an REU intern at the Institute for Creative Technology (USC) where I worked on deep learning for statistical inference on human complex choices. This is an ongoing project and I am currently in association with ICT to publish these results.</p> 
		
	<p> While my research interests tend to fluctuate, my overarching focus is at the intersection of dynamical systems and deep learning. My recent work encompasses combinatorial optimization of vehicle routing problems with dynamical systems and physical realizations of deep networks using nonlinear oscillators. </p>
