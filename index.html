	<p>Hello there! My name is <b>Tyler King</b> and I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am currently involved in numerous research labs, including <a href="https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/">Space Systems Design Studio</a>, <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">McMahon's Lab</a>, and <a href="https://www.peese.org/">Process-Energy-Environmental Systems Engineering (PEESE) Lab</a>. This summer I am interning at the Institute for Creative Technology (at USC) where I work on deep learning for statistical inference with human-like complex choices. </p> 
		
	<p> While my research interests tend to fluctuate, my overarching focus is at the intersection of algorithmic analysis and optimization. My recent work encompasses continuous and combinatorial optimization utilizing atypical approaches such as hybrid quantum computing and Ising solvers, along with algorithmic estimation in control theory. </p>
