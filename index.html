	<p> My name is <b>Tyler King</b> and I am an undergraduate/masters of engineering student at Cornell University working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am currently associated with <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">McMahon Lab</a>, where I work on simulating dynamics of the coherent Ising machine for vehicle routing problems in collaboration with ExxonMobil. Last summer I interned at <a href="https://ntt-research.com/phi/">NTT Physics and Informatics Lab</a> under the guidance of Tatsuhiro Onodera working on simulated oscillator neural networks. 

	<p> While my research interests tend to fluctuate, my overarching focus is at the intersection of dynamical systems and deep learning. My recent work encompasses dynamical systems for combinatorial optimization and machine learning, along with deep learning for human-AI classification on nonlinear tasks. I've additionally contributed on an open-source repository for simulating dynamics of various coherent Ising machines, which can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/mcmahon-lab/cim-optimizer/">cim-optimizer</a>. </p>
