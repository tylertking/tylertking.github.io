	<p class="lead"><b>About Me</b></p>
	<p> My name is <b>Tyler King</b> and I am an undergraduate engineering student at Cornell University working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am currently associated with <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">McMahon Lab</a>, where I work on simulating dynamics of the coherent Ising machine for vehicle routing problems (in collaboration with ExxonMobil) and simulated dynamics of oscillator neural networks. Last summer I interned at AWS AI leveraging foundational models for image annotation/tagging as a part of <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">Ground Truth</a>'s human annotation pipeline. 

	<p> While my research interests tend to fluctuate, my overarching focus is on efficient machine learning. To support this I draw from various fields including physical systems, human cognition, and classical machine learning approaches. My current and past work operates at this intersection, including: </p>
	<ul style="list-style: none;">
		<li>Physical inductive biases for performant low-parameterized model architectures.</li>
		<li>Model reduction with explicitly encoded cognition states (exploration/exploitation) for human-based nonlinear optimization tasks.</li>
		<li> Model reduction for edge ML with space-to-space imaging applications. </li>
		<li>Accelerating foundational model invocations with multicore implementations. </li>
	</ul>

	<p> 
		I've additionally contributed to several open-source initiatives, including development of a repository for simulating dynamics of various coherent Ising machines, which can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/mcmahon-lab/cim-optimizer/">cim-optimizer</a> (for which I currently maintain).
