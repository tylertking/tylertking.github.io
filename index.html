	<p class="lead"><b>About Me</b></p>
	<p> My name is <b>Tyler King</b> and I am a recent engineering graduate from Cornell University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Currently, I work at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">AWS Bedrock</a>, evaluating foundation models and building ML infrastructure as part of model migration. In my downtime, I work in the <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">McMahon Lab</a>, where I train coupled oscillator neural networks for efficient ML inference.  
		
	<p> My broad interest is efficient ML, especially at the intersection of controllable physical systems and software. I am excited about co-designed hardware/algorithms that can provide orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains for ML workloads, scaling beyond traditional von Neumann computing constraints. </p>
		
	<!-- My past experiences operate in this area, encompassing: </p>
	<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
		<li>Coupled oscillator networks for low-energy ML inference. </li>
		<li>Physical inductive biases for performant low-parameter model architectures. </li>
		<li>Improving computational overhead in optical imagers via uncertainty quantification. </li>
		<li>Model reduction with explicitly encoded cognition states or BatchNorm generalizations. </li>
	</ul> -->

	<p> 
		I've additionally contributed to several open-source initiatives, including development of a repository for simulating dynamics of various coherent Ising machines, which can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/mcmahon-lab/cim-optimizer/">cim-optimizer</a> (for which I currently maintain).
