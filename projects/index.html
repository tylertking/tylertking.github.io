	<h3>Projects</h3>
	<p>As an engineer, I've done most of my work in <a href="/projects/hardware" title = "Hardware">hardware</a> - whether making a lathe for a class or creating autonomous robots. I do have some <a href="/projects/software" title = "Software">software</a>-only projects, but they have generally been for embedded systems.</p>

	<p>For something a bit different, check out my <a href="/projects/writing" title = "Writing">writing</a> to see my commentary and analysis on various media as well as some original creative pieces.  I am still learning as an artist, but you can look at some of my <a href="/projects/art" title = "Art"> art</a> here. </p>
