<h3>Cross-Stitching</h3>
<p>I started cross-stitch in Dec. 2019, because of this <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/EBtyT">Shitpost Sampler goose pattern</a> sent to me by a friend. I was so taken by it that I taught myself from online resources in order to learn how to make it. This started a near addiction in me, especially as I found myself with a lot of time and screen burnout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most of my traditional hobbies became off limits, cross-stitching quickly became my go-to.</p>
<p>Below is just the final products. Statistics of completion can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vcd6L7MHAWh-QI90RvRpkCAWClIS9qQJx9g54hU0ncg/edit#gid=930961933">here</a> and timelapse videos can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68ZlYWDbKuckMvzBOga0BcritA8-QWuF">here</a>.</p>

<h4><br>Self-Drafted Designs</h4>
<p>Pieces that I played a major role in both the design and stitch process. Very few of these are made <em>ex nihilo</em>; details of the reference material was sourced is included in each picture description. I have three general ways that I make patterns: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Throw reference photo into <a href="https://gimplearn.net/viewtopic.php?p=3397#p3397">this GIMP plugin</a> and modify on the fly while stitching</li>
	<li>Re-draw pre-existing art in <a href="https://apps.kde.org/en/kxstitch">kxstitch</a> or <a href="https://flosscross.com/">FlossCross</a></li>
	<li>Print out reference photo, trace on graph paper</li>
</ul>

Throughout this process, I am very indebted to CS-Pattern's many solid resources, including:
<ol>
	<li><a href="https://cs-pattern.com/dmc-color-picker.php">Thread eyedropper tool for images</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://cs-pattern.com/dmc-short-list.php">Inventory management</a> and the associated <a href="https://cs-pattern.com/dmc-substitute-color-picker.php">thread substitution tool</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I use these tools for nearly every single self-drafted stitch that I do and has saved me both time and money by letting me stretch my floss stash to the fullest. </p>

<h5><br>Meme Alphabet</h5>
<p>This project started wtih me noticing that there were many single letter memes, such as <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/b-button-emoji-%F0%9F%85%B1">B</a>, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lord-marquaad-e">E</a> and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-f-to-pay-respects">F</a>, and wondering how far through the alphabet I could go. It turns out quite a lot, especially since I expanded my definition to include "memes that look like the letter's shape". If you know of more letter-based memes that I should include, please <a href="https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/">let me know!</a> All of these patterns are self-drafted by me using <a href="https://gimplearn.net/viewtopic.php?p=3397#p3397">this GIMP plugin</a>, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I chose to include a couple of alt-right symbols and other memes with problematic origins in this piece, I would like to emphasize that I do not support any of their ideologies. I chose to include them in order to reflect more of the biased state of the Internet, especially when cast in this alphabet sampler framework. I am very open to further dialogue about this and strongly encourage feedback. Please <a href="https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/">let me know!</a></p>

<h3>Glassblowing</h3>
<p>I was very fortunate to get selected for the beginner's glassblowing class in Fall 2016 at MIT. This class is heavily oversubscribed and lottery dependent, so I had been trying for the past 4 years trying to get into the class. I spent 8 weeks learning how to blow glass, working up from paperweights to cups to pulled-neck vases.</p>

<p>After staying at MIT for grad school, lightning struck twice and I got into the Spring 2019 beginner's glassblowing class. I was surprised how much muscle memory stayed even though it had been nearly two years since I got to be a gaffer. I definitely felt like I had significantly more control over my pieces and got to practice more on making the entire process faster</p>

<p>After this, I was selected to be in the 2020 intermediate glassblowing class. This class was much more focused on producing better pieces more consistently, so unfortunately, I don't have many pictures of this class. This class was also cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, so it will remain to be seen whether I can get back into the Glass Lab once more.</p>

<h3>Woodworking</h3>
<p>Since I lived in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/">Random Hall</a> and <a href="http://www.eastcamp.us/">East Campus</a>, both East Side dorms with a culture of building, I was used to building little improvements to my room - whether a shelf or a loft. Although those "pieces" are mostly just from scrap wood from whatever fort or rollercoaster East Campus decided to make this year, I have a few nice woodworking pieces with actual finished wood.</p>

<h4><br>2.75 - Kinematic Coupled Tea Set</h4>
<p>Although the main thrust of 2.75 is the <!-- TODO: link medical device here -->medical device that you work on for the entire year, there are side projects as part of the class. We were tasked to make any project that involved a <a href="http://kinematiccouplings.org/">kinematic coupling</a>, a way to exactly constrain (instead of overconstrain) two components, thus ensuring precision layout. I decided to make a kinematically coupled tea set so that my tea-loving boyfriend could host tea parties more easily. My report can be found <a href="/files/Chin_KC_writeup.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm overall very pleased with how my project came out. I used the <a href="http://studentlife.mit.edu/hobbyshop">Hobby Shop</a> for the first time, an extremely nice and friendly machine shop on campus, and learned how to use wood stain and sealant. I used a band saw + jig to cut out the main circles, a CNC router for the inset circles, a router + jig for the V-grooves and the Random Hall laser cutter to etch the characters. </p>

<h3>Blacksmithing</h3>
<p>I got to take the Introduction to Blacksmithing class over IAP 2016 where I got to learn basic techniques such as how to make tapers, scrolls, and twists and how to build up more complex pieces from there. I ended up making a snail doorstop which involved forge welding two pieces of metal together into one shape. I also went to Open Forge infrequently through 2016 and 2017, where I tried to make bottle openers, forks and spoons.</p>

<h3>Metal Projects</h3>
<h4>2.670 - Flashlight</h4>
<p>2.670 is the introduction to machining class for mechanical engineers. I took it in IAP 2015. There, we followed the Edgerton Shop training which is to build a flashlight using a mill and lathe. I had never used a lathe before, so this was a good class to take before taking <a href="/projects/hardware/lathe.html">2.72</a>.</p>

The battery is in the handle, so the connection is controlled by twisting the flashlight head."%}

<h4><br>2.008 - Paperweight</h4>
<p>As part of 2.008, in addition to the main <a href="/projects/hardware/yoyo.html">yoyo manufacturing project</a>, there was the paperweight project. We had to make a yoyo of our own design that would use both a CNC lathe and mill. I chose to make a paperweight that had the logo of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.">Super Smash Bros. game series </a>. From this project, I learned how to use MasterCam to plot out the machining paths as well as write up a process plan.</p>
