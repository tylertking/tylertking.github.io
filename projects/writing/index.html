<h3>Writing </h3>
<p>The following are some pieces that I am particularly proud of. Some are papers from classes that I have taken at MIT, while others are just personal writing</p>

<h4>litchin@ and mellifluously@</h4>
<p>Since 2014, I have had a literary mailing list (litchin@) and a musical mailing list (mellifluously@) which I would send various musings to. An archive of posts made (albeit missing the lively community of responses) can be found <a href="http://litchin.wordpress.com">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Jeopardy - 2017 to present</h4>
<p>After winning the <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/tournaments/2017/college-championship">2017 Jeopardy College Championship</a> with "Who is the spiciest memelord?", I got quite a taste of internet celebrity. My media studies training helped me make sense of the entire process.</p>

<p>This space is reserved for my own writing. Interviews with me can be found on my <a href="/press/index.html">press page</a></p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/5w6rmp/i_am_lilly_chin_2017_college_championship_winner/">Reddit AMA</a> I conducted on /r/Jeopardy</li>
	<li> <a href="/files/ltchin_Nanofame.pdf">"Memetic Nanofame"</a> - a presentation I gave for the <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/learn/HSSP/index.html">Summer HSSP</a> 2017 lecture series about what my Jeopardy experiences taught me about fame and media. Video of me presenting these slides for Twitch is archived <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0IEF1OTFRM">here</a></li>

<h4>Alice - 2015 to present</h4>
<p>After taking 21L.430 / CMS.920 (Narrative and Popular Culture: Children's Cultural Blockbusters) with <a href="http://lit.mit.edu/people/mgubar/">Professor Marah Gubar</a> in Spring 2015, I turned my passing interest in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> into a more scholarly one. I ended up teaching several classes about Alice and children's literature in general for <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/teach/teachers/ltchin/bio.html">MIT's Educational Studies Program</a>, modifying what I had learned from Professor Gubar into a class of my own.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/files/ltchin_21L430Final.pdf">21L.430 final paper</a> about how the 2010 Burton version of Alice turns her into a destroyer of narrative, civilization and childhood through its removal of nonsense (Spring 2015)</li>
<li><a href="/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015Prep.pdf">Preparation notes</a> and <a href="/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015InClass.pdf">in-class notes</a> from my Splash 2015 class. </li>

<h4>21L.706 - Studies in Film: Color in Film - Spring 2017</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="https://lit.mit.edu/people/ebrinkema/">Professor Eugenie Brinkema</a>, the professor who inspired me to minor in Comparative Media Studies through her stunning teaching of 21L.011 - The Film Experience. For my last undergraduate semester at MIT, I took her seminar about color in film which pushed my analytical skills more than ever before.</p>
 <ul>
 	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_21L706Midterm.pdf">Midterm paper</a> about how color exerts violence and trauma on the characters of <i>Upstream Color</i> and <i>Red Desert</i></li>
 	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_21L706Final.pdf">Final paper</a> about understanding the inherent contradictions within the monochrome by tracing its violence / redemption in <i>Blue</i>, <i>Tower</i>, and <i>Vertigo</i></li>
 </ul>

<h4>CMS.616 - Games and Culture - Fall 2016</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://tltaylor.com/">Professor TL Taylor</a>. It's honestly been an honor to work with her and I've really enjoyed looking more in-depth in sociological issues around gaming. Although the papers were a bit more surface level than I would have liked, I definitely feel like I have the groundwork for doing more research</p>
 <ul>
 	<li><a href="https://litchin.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/cms-616-multiplayer-tetris/">Midterm paper</a> studying the dynamics of different Tetris communities. </li>
 	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_CMS616Final.pdf">Final paper</a> about the co-creative relationship between speedrunners and developers. </li>
 </ul>

<h4>CMS.845 - Interactive Narrative - Spring 2016</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://www.nickm.com/classes/interactive_narrative/2016_spring/">Professor Nick Montfort</a>. It's been the first time in a while since I've done a creative writing class since elementary school and I found the work really cool.</p>

<h4>CMS.300 - Introduction to Video Game Theory - Fall 2015</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/mikael-jakobsson/">Professor Mikael Jakobsson</a>. I really enjoyed this class and managed to write papers that I didn't feel were overly rushed by my college life. I also really appreciated the opportunity to dig deeply into game studies, which was something I never had a formal grounding in before taking this class.</p>
<ul>
