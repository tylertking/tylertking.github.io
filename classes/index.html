<h2> Teaching </h2>

<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2023fa/">CS 4780: Machine Learning</a><br>
<em>Fall 2023, Spring 2024, Fall 2024</em><br>
The course provides an introduction to machine learning, focusing on supervised learning and its theoretical foundations. Topics include regularized linear models, boosting, kernels, deep networks, generative models, online learning, and ethical questions arising in ML applications.<br>

<em>Spring 2024</em><br>
This course will provide the necessary mathematical and modeling tools needed to describe and understand these network systems. Questions of interest will be how the network structure impacts the dynamics of network systems, how network properties can be exploited to maximize system performance or resilience and how one can address these questions while also accounting for strategic human behavior. The course will introduce tools that can be used to address these questions and successfully overcome challenges related to the coupled, distributed, and large-scale nature of network systems in environments with limited sensing, communication, and control capabilities.
